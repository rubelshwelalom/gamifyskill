# SimpleQuiz Smart Contract

## Vision
The **SimpleQuiz** smart contract is designed to facilitate the creation and management of quizzes on the Ethereum blockchain. It enables users to create multiple-choice quizzes and allows participants to attempt these quizzes to verify if their answers are correct. This decentralized approach ensures transparency and immutability in quiz management.

## Flowchart
Below is a flowchart illustrating the primary interactions with the **SimpleQuiz** contract:

```
+-------------------+            +--------------------+            +-----------------------+
|                   |            |                    |            |                       |
|  User Creates     |            |  Contract Stores   |            |  Quiz Created         |
|  Quiz             +----------->+  Quiz Data         +----------->+  Confirmation Message |
|                   |            |                    |            |                       |
+-------------------+            +--------------------+            +-----------------------+

## Contract Address
The contract is currently deployed on the Ethereum Rinkeby Testnet at the following address:

```
0xYourContractAddressHere
```

Please replace `0xYourContractAddressHere` with the actual address upon deployment.

## Future Scope
- **Quiz Management**: Add functionality to update or delete existing quizzes.
- **Advanced Features**: Implement quiz metadata such as difficulty levels or categories.
- **User Scoring**: Develop a scoring system to track users' performance across multiple quizzes.
- **Front-End Integration**: Create a user-friendly interface for interacting with the contract via web3 technologies.
